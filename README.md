# Historical-Stock-Prices-Analysis
A repository for the analysis of the historical stock prices of the top 10 popular companies in the United States of America. <br />
The datasets used for this project are included in the repository. <br />

## Introduction
In this project, I analysed the records of the stock prices of the top 10 popular companies (Apple, 
Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Walmart, Uber and Zoom) in the United States of America from the year 2011 to 2021. <br />
The aim of the project is to;
* Compare the stock price growth between the companies. <br />
* Predict the stock price growth of the companies. <br />

## Data Exploration
The datasets of this project contains 10 CSV files containing data for each of the 10 popular companies. I imported the files into Tableau and create a union of all files. The following are some of the key insights I generated;
* Total Stock Volume = 487 Billion
* Average Low Price = $416.94
* Average High Price = $426.65
* Average Opening Price = $421.90
* Average Adjusted Closing Price = $421
